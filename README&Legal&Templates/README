CWA 15793 2011 Planning and Implementation Tool version 1.0.0-alpha

Description: 
This software, built on the open source platform Electron (runs on Chromium and Node.js), is designed to assist organizations in the implementation 
of a biorisk management system consistent with the requirements of the international, publicly available guidance document CEN Workshop Agreement 15793:2011 (CWA 15793). 
The software includes tools for conducting organizational gap analysis against CWA 15793 requirements, planning tools to support the implementation of CWA 15793 requirements, 
and performance monitoring support. The gap analysis questions are based on the text of CWA 15793, and its associated guidance document, CEN Workshop Agreement 16393:2012. 
The authors have secured permission from the publisher of CWA 15793, the European Committee for Standardization (CEN), to use language from the document in the software, 
with the understanding that the software will be made available freely, without charge.

Future plans and extensions:
The eventual goal is to iteratively improve the CWA 15793 2011 Tool to include a simpler surveying process and quantitative reports. Extensions, such as cloud database support, 
are possible and contingent upon user demand. There is also a possibility of using the application framework as the basis for a suite of biorisk management applications.

Data stored by the program:
Evaluation data is only stored within a JSON database that held locally in the root of the installation directory. You can find where this directory is stored by 
right clicking on the desktop icon and opening the file location. The database is called “evaldb.json.” It is not recommended that you edit the JSON file directly; 
mechanisms to purge data from the database are available from within the application. There is currently no published method to encrypt the data inside the JSON file. 

Updates:
Occasional security and software updates may be automatically offered upon application startup. Note that this is not an indication that the author warranties the software.
